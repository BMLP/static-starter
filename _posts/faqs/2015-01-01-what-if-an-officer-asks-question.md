* You are never obligated to answer any questions.
* However, Ohio law requires you to identify yourself if:
  * (1) You are suspected of a crime; or
  * (2) You are a witness to a felony.
* Loudly & clearly ask, “Am I legally required to identify myself?”
* If the answer is yes, ONLY then are you obligated provide:
  * Legal name, Date of Birth, and Address
  * If you refuse to identify yourself in those situations, you can be arrested.
* You are not required to give a statement about anything that you witnessed or are suspected of.
